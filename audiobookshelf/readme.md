# Audiobookshelf

A tool for managing AudioBooks and Podcasts. 

## Setup

Start the compose, making sure that you are pointing to the right folder location for your audiobooks. 
On the first startup, Audiobookshelf will prompt you to create the first user. 

After logging in, you will need to add libraries for any existing AudioBooks or Podcasts. 

## Additional tools

 - [Libation](https://getlibation.com/) is a tool to help download your books from Audible into a format that is compatible with Audiobookshelf. 

## TODO

 - Authentication via LDAP or OAuth. Currently seems to be not supported, so accounts must be managed separately.
